# Batch Design

This folder details the algorithm in sections **III-A** and **IV-A** of the 
paper.

`experiment.py`: Generates a `batch_scores.p` file which is 
used for generating the data table and figure. This code runs is under one 
minute.

`table.py`: Prints a table of design sequence scores of desired ranks.

`figure.py`: Saves a histogram `batch_results.png` of the objective scores.
